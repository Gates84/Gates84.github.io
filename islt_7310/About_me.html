    <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hi, I’m Jeff.<br>
        <p>I’m an aspiring UI and UX Designer out of the St. Louis Area. I enjoy finding creative solutions while making interactive experiences both fun and enjoyable.</p>
        <p>I’m currently working towards earning my Masters in Information Technology and Design with a certificate in User Experience and Usability at the University of Missouri. With just one year left in my program, I’m working constantly to grow as a designer while I hunt for new job opportunities.</p>
        <p>I was born with an insatiable curiosity, I’m always learning new skills and programs and taking on new tasks. When I’m not designing sites, apps, or packaging, I’m usually either woodworking, painting, or writing.</p>
