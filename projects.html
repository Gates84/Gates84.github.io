        <h3>MyZou</h3>
    </div>
     <div class="layout">

    </div>   
    <div class="container_1">
        <p> The challenge presented to us was to redesign the MyZou student homepage to increase the usability of the site and the discoverability of information available. A student survey revealed that the greater majority of students found the original site very difficult to navigate. Our biggest constraint was time. We had a three-month deadline to finish the redesign. This included gathering research, analyzing our user data, and figuring out how best to craft a space where students could accomplish all their tasks while keeping the design intuitive and fun to use. The most exciting challenge was designing a way for students to enroll in their semester classes with just three clicks!</p>

    <div class="container_2">
        <p>For this design, I used Sketch to create the research analysis charts, user personas, the site map, and both the low and high fidelity prototypes. After some reflection, I decided to take the class project design and update the layout as I continued more principles of design. I added gradients, lightened the contrast with the gray, and flipped the enrollment layout to create a more natural flow.</p>

    <h3>Unify</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="layout">

    <div class="container_1">
        <p>Unify is a social media network where teachers can connect with fellow educators from across the country or within their own district to share resources, form planning teams, ask for advice, and be paired with volunteer mentors. The site also houses a database where instructional coaches can post articles, sharing their wisdom and personal development lessons.</P>

    <div class="container_3"></div>
        <p>The heart of the site centers around sharing and forming planning teams to save each other time and headaches. Time is the number one enemy of teachers when each year teams of two or three are required to come up with over 175 hours of content. The average teacher works between 60-80 hours each week, but with a team of ten or twelve or even twenty, teachers could have their lessons planned weeks in advance, and finally have time on their side.</p>

    </div>    
        <p>For this project, I created the initial mixed-method survey and conducted two rounds of interviews. After analyzing the data collected, I created an empathy map and five personas. Using Sketch, I created a site map, helped to draft the wireframes, and designed the high-fidelity prototype.</p>

        <p>Project Manager is a game that teaches management and leadership. The player is a relatively new "Project Manager‚Äù for a company conducting research for a new mobile application. In-game, you can walk around the office talking to your team, check your email, and speak with your boss in her office.</p>

        <img src="webpage assets/Angry Andy.png" alt="Gameplay">
        <p>Your actions and decisions are assessed by two bars displayed in the top left corner. Your decisions have a direct effect on the morale of the team and the progress of the project. Disgruntled team members work slowly and making poor decisions could cost your team time and efficiency.</p>
