     Hello Everyone, 

My name is Jeff, I’m starting my last year in the program and planning to go into User Experience (UX) Design. I’m new to coding and wanting to learn the basics so I can have a general knowledge and appreciation for what my designs are asking of developers. A mentor of mine suggested I do so, because one little design choice could potentially add an extra six months of coding. I think understanding coding will help me avoid that. Plus, I am just interested to learn more web design related skills that could potentially help me in my career. I hope this class will help me learn enough coding that I could if needed, code better interactions for my portfolio. When I’m not designing, I enjoy woodworking, gaming, working out and writing. Over winter break, I had to have a couple surgeries, and I started writing again to help fill all the down time.
