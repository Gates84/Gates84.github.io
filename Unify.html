        <p>Unify is a social media network where teachers can connect with fellow educators from across the country or within their own district to share resources, form planning teams, ask for advice, and be paired with volunteer mentors. The site also houses a database where instructional coaches can post articles, sharing their wisdom and personal development lessons.</P>

        <p>The heart of the site centers around sharing and forming planning teams to save each other time and headaches. Time is the number one enemy of teachers when each year teams of two or three are required to come up with over 175 hours of content. The average teacher works between 60-80 hours each week, but with a team of ten or twelve or even twenty, teachers could have their lessons planned weeks in advance, and finally have time on their side.</p>

        <p>For this project, I created the initial mixed-method survey and conducted two rounds of interviews. After analyzing the data collected, I created an empathy map and five personas. Using Sketch, I created a site map, helped to draft the wireframes, and designed the high-fidelity prototype.</p>
