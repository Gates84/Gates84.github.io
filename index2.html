    <h3>Hello and welcome to my portfolio!</h3>
    <p> I would like to begin by thanking you for taking the time to peruse my portfolio - where you will learn more about me, some of my work, highlights from my experience, and more. As you navigate my site, I hope you enjoy seeing just a few of my projects and demonstrated abilities. Each project sample lays out the project prompt, the challenges and constraints faced, and the steps I used to successfully complete each project. As you navigate through my portfolio projects, you will learn more about how I approach my work and the processes I apply when tackling various scenarios and problems. </p>
    <p>I want to thank you for taking the time to review my portfolio site and included projects. As you do so, if you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or requests, please do not hesitate to reach out to me via my Contact page. </p>
