        <h3>Reflection</h3>
<div class="container_1">
    <p>As I reflect on the past few years, I can’t help but think of how I got here. I started off as an educator who, like many educators, felt completely overwhelmed and out of their depth. It’s one thing to learn a subject, but it's entirely different to teach it. No matter how difficult things got though, I refused to give up. When you’re teaching children, failure isn’t an option. I used to joke that I worked more hours than the sun. Working for a room full of kids with all different kinds of personalities and needs you had to learn to adapt quickly. I had straight A students reading at college level one minute and then I had students who came to me not speaking a word of English. After working in education for a few years, I found myself needing a change.</p>
    <p>I entered the Information Technology and Design program at the University of Missouri with the intent of becoming an archivist, but I quickly found that I was more interested in designing an archive than actually working in one. My wife, who works in UX, suggested I take a fun UI design class and I immediately felt at home. Since then, I switched my focus to User Experience and Usability, and I’ve been reading up on design. I’ve taught myself Sketch, Figma, XD, Photoshop and Illustrator. I’ve conducted user research studies and designed high fidelity prototypes for a handful of sites. I’ve created mockups of packaging, and now I’m learning to code.</p>
    <p>Throughout the program I’ve learned how to conduct usability studies and how to analyze data. I’ve worked remotely in teams with design deadlines and learned how to keep the channel of communication open. I’ve enjoyed learning different areas of design where proper UX fundamentals can be applied. One semester I worked redesigning a student portal for our university, and then the next I worked with a different team designing an online educational course for incorporating AR and VR experiences in the classroom. In another class, I studied game design and completed three projects - one being a fully developed prototype created with Construct 3.</p>
    <p>If there’s anything I’ve learned over the last few years it’s that I am capable of so much more than I thought possible. I’ve managed to maintain a 3.8 GPA while teaching myself numerous programs and meeting each deadline head on, even with the on going pandemic. I find a lot of the skills I learned during my time as a teacher have crossed over into my UX career. I’m still creating content and designing for people with varied backgrounds and needs. And with each project, I’m constantly thinking throughout the development how each choice will affect my users. I’m still clocking more hours than the sun, but I do so knowing that I’m working towards a brighter tomorrow. My career goals are to find a junior design position where I can continue learning and sharpen my skills further. I want to work at a job where I can have fun and create products that will make people happy.</p>
