        <p> The challenge presented to us was to redesign the MyZou student homepage to increase the usability of the site and the discoverability of information available. A student survey revealed that the greater majority of students found the original site very difficult to navigate. Our biggest constraint was time. We had a three-month deadline to finish the redesign. This included gathering research, analyzing our user data, and figuring out how best to craft a space where students could accomplish all their tasks while keeping the design intuitive and fun to use. The most exciting challenge was designing a way for students to enroll in their semester classes with just three clicks!</p>

        <p>For this design, I used Sketch to create the research analysis charts, user personas, the site map, and both the low and high fidelity prototypes. After some reflection, I decided to take the class project design and update the layout as I continued more principles of design. I added gradients, lightened the contrast with the gray, and flipped the enrollment layout to create a more natural flow.</p>
