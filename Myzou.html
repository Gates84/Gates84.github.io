                <p class="p_1"> The challenge presented to us was to redesign the MyZou student homepage to increase the usability of the site and the discoverability of information available. A student survey revealed that the greater majority of students found the
                    original site very difficult to navigate. Our biggest constraint was time. We had a three-month deadline to finish the redesign. This included gathering research, analyzing our user data, and figuring out how best to craft a space
                    where students could accomplish all their tasks while keeping the design intuitive and fun to use. The most exciting challenge was designing a way for students to enroll in their semester classes with just three clicks!</p>

                    <img src="https://gates84.github.io/Enrollment.png" alt="Myzou Enroll" class="image2">
                    <p class="p_2">For this design, I used Sketch to create the research analysis charts, user personas, the site map, and both the low and high fidelity prototypes. After some reflection, I decided to take the class project design and update the layout
                    as I continued more principles of design. I added gradients, lightened the contrast with the gray, and flipped the enrollment layout to create a more natural flow.</p>

                    <p class="p_3">Below, you can see a before and after of the Myzou Student Portal. Previously, the user had to rely heavily on memory to locate information scanning through numerous drop down menus that were labeled with ambigous terms. In the new design, the user can find the information they need daily on the the left side bar while less frequently needed information is located in the top navigation bar.</p>
